>- [^ **What is a Unary? What is its most common use case?**]A [**Unary**]() is a function decorator that modifies the number of arguments a function takes: Unary takes any function and turns it into a function taking exactly one argument.
> The most common use case is to fix a problem. JavaScript has a `.map` method for arrays, and many libraries offer a map function with the same semantics. Here it is in action:
```js 
['1', '2', '3'].map(parseFloat)
  //=> [1, 2, 3]
``` 
In that example, it looks exactly like the mapping function you’ll find in most languages: You pass it a function, and it calls the function with one argument, the element of the array. However, that’s not the whole story. JavaScript’s map actually calls each function with three arguments: The element, the index of the element in the array, and the array itself.

Let’s try it:
```js 
[1, 2, 3].map(function (element, index, arr) {
  console.log({element: element, index: index, arr: arr})
})
  //=> { element: 1, index: 0, arr: [ 1, 2, 3 ] }
  //   { element: 2, index: 1, arr: [ 1, 2, 3 ] }
  //   { element: 3, index: 2, arr: [ 1, 2, 3 ] }
``` 
If you pass in a function taking only one argument, it simply ignores the additional arguments. But some functions have optional second or even third arguments. For example:
```js 
['1', '2', '3'].map(parseInt)
  //=> [1, NaN, NaN]
``` 
This doesn’t work because parseInt is defined as `parseInt(string[, radix])`. It takes an optional radix argument. And when you call `parseInt` with `map`, the index is interpreted as a radix. Not good! What we want is to convert `parseInt` into a function taking only one argument.

We could write `['1', '2', '3'].map((s) => parseInt(s))`, or we could come up with a decorator to do the job for us:
```js 
const unary = (fn) =>
  fn.length === 1
    ? fn
    : function (something) {
        return fn.call(this, something)
      }
```
And now we can write:
```js 
['1', '2', '3'].map(unary(parseInt))
  //=> [1, 2, 3]
``` 
Presto!
