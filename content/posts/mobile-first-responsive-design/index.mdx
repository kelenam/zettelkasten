Using a mobile first approach is just coding a site with mobile sizes in mind at first, then move on to larger screen sizes: tablets, then browsers.

Setup your base html template. 
- Emmet is useful here.
- Liveserver, the VSCode plugin, to preview your static page
- create and link a stylesheet

## HTML Template
- New file `assets` for all your image assets
- create a new `nav` element and call it `site-nav grid`
  - nested in nav is h1 : Cosmo Junkie
  - Followed by ul
    - then li with `<a href="#portfolio">`
    - then li with href of skills 

- Creating a nav with 3 linked sections via a tags in lis in an unordered list.
- The sections and titles themselves aren't of class grid, only their contents which are wrapped in a div are going to be the things we want with a class of grid.
- we are also adding a form in the contact section
- we also have a footer with copyright and social media icons

## Mobile-First approach

### Mobile-First Design
- Design & code websites for mobiles first
- Gradually built it up to larger screens / desktops
- Polar opposite of what we used to do, mobile-site based on the desktop site. Often lead to smooshed poor-UX versions of our desktop site.
- easier to start small than expand out then the other way around

Use your preferred design tool and start with how it will look like in mobile first, then based in that, how it might look on the desktop as you gain more space.

Next thing is to setup the media-queries to set the break points. Here is how our CSS is going to be structured.

```css
/* variables */
/* resets */
/* base styles */
/* fonts */
/* mobile styles */
/* small tablet styles */
```

So starting from the mobile styles we want to write our media queries moving upwards, so next would be the small tablet styles, so let's go ahead and create that media query...

```css
/* variables */
/* resets */
/* base styles */
/* fonts */
/* mobile styles */
/* small tablet styles */
@media screen and (min-width: 620px) {

}
```
- Basic syntax, `@media` to specify the media query
- `screen` to target anything with a screen  
- `and` to specify the condition which is going to be ...
- `(min-width:620px)` - so as soon as a user with a screen of at least 620px that's where these styles will start applying.

Let's move onto the next media queries we would do...
```css
/* variables */
/* resets */
/* base styles */
/* fonts */
/* mobile styles */
/* small tablet styles */
@media screen and (min-width: 620px) {

}

/* large tablets & laptop styles */
@media screen and (min-width: 960px) {

}

/* desktop styles */
@media screen and (min-width: 1200px) {

}
```
There are no hard-absolute rules for media query break-points, but the following will work for the site we are creating:
- `620px` for small tablets
- `960px` for large tablets and laptops
- `1200px` for desktop styles

### The order in which we will write our styles
So the order in which we will write our styles is starting from the top of our comment seperators:
1. variables, resets, base styles, fonts
2. mobile styles
3. small tablet styles
4. large tablets & laptop styles
5. desktop styles

## Base Styles
We can create **variables** in css to store commonly used values used throughout our styles, like font-sizes or colors.
```css
/* variables */
:root {
  --primary: #FFC636;
  --secondary: #0A0B5B;
}
```
This allows us to change our styles for our colors in one place and not every where its referenced.

### resets to get rid of default browser styles
The next thing we want to address is the resets of the default browser styles.
```css
/* variables */
body,p,a,ul,li {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  text-decoration: none;
}
li {
  list-style-type: none;
}
```

### Moving on to our base styles
```css
/* base styles */
body {
  background: var(--secondary);
  overflow-x: hidden;
}
```
- To use our css variables, we use the `var` keyword followed by parens and the name of our variable, in this case `--secondary`

The next thing we specify is the overflow in the x direction to be `hidden`, the reason for this is we want the hero image to be off screen a little bit and we don't want users to be able to scroll and view that image.

#### Style our `<button>` class
```css {6-13}
/* base styles */
body {
  background: var(--secondary);
  overflow-x: hidden;
}
.button {
  background: none;
  border: 2px solid var(--primary);
  color: var(--primary);
  padding: 6px 12px;
  border-radius: 20px;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  box-shadow: 1px 2px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.6);
  display: inline-block;
}
```
- `display: inline-block` is going to help with styling and adding some margin to it so it's not overlapping with the p tag above it.
- We also want a hover effect so we say `button:hover`
- Benefit of variables, is we can just keep themed colors at the top and update everywhere else.

#### Style input,textarea
```css
input,textarea {
    background: rgba(0,0,0,0.05);
    padding: 10px 16px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    border: 2px solid #9893D8;
    color: #f2f2f2;
}
```

## Fonts
We want to use the Rubik font. Once downloaded from google fonts, we can go ahead and include it in our `assets` folder within a new folder called `fonts`, all we need is the `.ttf` file, for the `Rubik-Regular` font.

Now we can use this font in our css, we will do use using the `@font-face` rule.

### @font-face rule
- This is how we use a custom font, because normally we can only use web-safe fonts, but if we use our own, we can register it by saying
```css
/* fonts */
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Rubik Regular'
}
```
- So now, once we've given it a name, we can now reference this font by the name(alias) we've given it, e.g. like in the body tag we can just say `font-family: 'Rubik Regular'`.
- We also need to say where we get that font from and we do so with the `src` property:
- We must provide the path, relative to the styles file.: `src: url('assets/fonts/Rubik-Regular.ttf')`;

- Next let's move on to headers and p,a,li tags:
```css
/* fonts */
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Rubik Regular'
}
h1,h2,h3,h4 {
  color: #DDDBFF;
  font-weight: normal;
}
p,a,li {
  color: #9893D8;
}
h1,h3 {
  font-size: 1.2em;
}
h2 {
  font-size: 1.6em;
}
h4 {
  font-size: 1.1.em;
}
.leading {
  font-size: 1.1em;
}
```
- we use ems for our h1,h3. ems are scalable units instead of fixed px size.
  - ems get their value from the default browser style and then multiples it by the given em. e.g. default browswer could be 16px, 2em would be 32px.
- You can always override the default font size in our `body` selector.
- ⭐ When it comes to responsive design its much easier to use a base default font size in the `body` selector and then use ems for the different elements. 
  - Because then in most cases, that means you just need to define your font styles once using ems once and then we can just update the default font size in each media query selector for the different screen types and they will scale accordingly.
```css
/* large tablets & laptop styles */
@media screen and (min-width: 960px) {
  body {
    font-size: 18px;
  }
}

/* desktop styles */
@media screen and (min-width: 1200px) {
  body {
    font-size: 20px;
  }
}
```

## Grid Basics

How does CSS Grid work? Imagine that your page is comprised of an underlying grid of say (4 rows and 6 columns; it's up to you).

Grid lines are what separate these grids into sections.
- <a href="##Grid Basics">grid lines</a> start from left to right horizontally. If we have 6 columns, we will have 7 grid lines.
- grid lines increase vertically from top down for rows.

### Grid Container
In order for us to use the grid we must make a parent element a grid container...
- we do that by using a css selector and setting that elements `display` property to `grid`
```html
<div>
  <a>one</a>
  <a>two</a>
  <a>three</a>
</div>
```
```css
div {
  display: grid;
}
```

### Setting # of columns and their width
Next we need to define the number of columns and what their width should be.
- If we want 3 columns we define 3 different widths by providing the width of each column...
- You can use pixels for defining your widths, however, fractions work better, e.g. `1fr`
- the `fr` unit means whatevever the full width of the grid is, the fraction is 1 equal fraction of that grid.

```css
div {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 200px;
}
```
- In our project, we set the `.projects` to use css grid, with 3 1fr columns.

### Centering items within their column
The next thing we want to do is center those images to their column:
```css {4,7-10}
projects {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 10px;
}

projects a {
  text-align: center;
  padding: 20px;
}
```
- we also have access to a `gap` property that we add to the gird container that gives us the ability to create gaps between columns/rows.
- What automatically happens if there is another item in the container is that item goes into the next row. 

### Section Review 
1. Set your parent/wrapper element's `display` property to `grid`.
2. Define the number of columns that grid should have and what width each column should be.
  - using the property `grid-template-columns`. The # of values you provide is how many columns you want.
  - the value you pass is their width, e.g. `200px` or `1fr`. 

## Creating a 12-Column Grid
Normally most layout systems in CSS make use of a 12 column grid system. So, let's try creating a 12 column grid with CSS instead.
- Remember, line numbers are always one more than the the number of columns we have.
- We could technically do something like:
```css
/* NOT THE BEST WAY */
selector {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
}
```
- The above is a bit unslightly, instead we can use the `repeat` function: `repeat(#ofTimesToRepeat, columnSize)`.
  - Under the hood its doing what we see above, but its easier for us humans to read.
```css
selector {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
}
```
- By default,  If we have 3 items in the container, they get automatically placed in the first 3 columns to the left.
- However, we can control where they go with `grid-column: columnToStart/columnToEnd` e.g. `grid-column: 1/5;`
- We can even use `grid-row: desiredRow` to specify which row to put the element on.
![](/12-column-grid.png)

- If we apply to this to our project, and use `repeat(12, 1fr)`, it won't look like things change that much and that is because the images we are using are stretching the individual cells to be as big.
If we set the `.projects img` to have a `max-width: 100%`, you will see that our images are appearing as the first 3 elements in the 12 column grid.

#### Using nth-child pseudo-class to grab nth item
- We can use the `nth-child()` pseudoclass to grab specific elements in our ul by saying....
```css
.projects a:nth-child(1) {
  grid-column: 2/6;
  grid-row: 1;
}
.projects a:nth-child(2) {
  grid-column: 8/12;
  grid-row: 1;
}
.projects a:nth-child(3) {
  grid-column: 5/9;
  grid-row: 2;
}
```

## Mobiles Styles (Part 1)

### Setting up our grid class and styling our h1
Delete the grid testing code we did, and let's apply what we learned to the mobile styles.
- You can see we have the `grid` class used in a few places. We are going to be using an 8 column grid for this design.
```css
/* mobile styles */
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(8, 1fr);
}
.site-nav {
  margin: 0 20px;
}
.site-nav ul {
  display: none;
}
.
```
- We want to give a bit of margin to our site-nav, however our sitenav ul doens't really need to be shown on mobile so we can hide it.
- We also want to style up site-nav h1 and give it a bit of a border at the bottom. Since it's in a grid parent, it become a grid item, and right now its being smooshed because its only sitting in one columb by default: let's give it more columns to spread across: `grid-column:1/4` let's be explicit and set its row to 1, and give it some 10px padding on the bottom and a 3px solid primary colored bottom border.

### Styling Welcome
- aside: a lot of people don't like using id in CSS and instead prefer using classes, but if you use ids properly then this shouldn't be problematic.
- We will style our #welcome id element.
```css
#weclcome {
  padding: 0 0px 20px 20px;
}
.welcome-text {
  grid-column: 1/6;
}
.welcome-img {
  grid-column: 6/9;
}
.welcome-img img {
  width: 200%;
}
.welcome-text a {
  margin: 20px 0;
}
```

#### Resizing images: width % is container size not image size
At the moment, this image is a bit big, and that's because it is showing at the default size. Let's override that with
`width: 200%;`. **This isn't 200% of the original image size, but instead it means 200% of whatever is containing it**, in this case it's the width of these columns.

> Note: I got mixed up in application, trying to apply the width to the welcome-img div itself, and forgetting to specifically specify `.welcome-img img`, using the `img` selector.

### Styling our Button
It's the anchor tag in our welcome-text so `.welcome-text a`, let's set it's top and bottom margin to 20px and left and right to 0.

## Mobiles Styles (Part 2)
Let's style our Portfolio section
```css 
#portfolio {
  background: url(assets/square_bg.png);
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: bottom;
  padding: 30px 20px;
} 
#portfolio {
  margin-bottom: 0;
  text-align: center;
}
.projects a {
  grid-template-columns: 1/9;
  margin: 20px 0;
}
```
Our projects are in the grid, so we need to grab those via their anchor tags.
- On mobile we want these to stack on top of each, the full length of the grid. That means from column line 1 to 9.

### Addressing Image Size and Centering
```css {15-20}
#portfolio {
  background: url(assets/square_bg.png);
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: bottom;
  padding: 30px 20px;
} 
#portfolio {
  margin-bottom: 0;
  text-align: center;
}
.projects a {
  grid-template-columns: 1/9;
  margin: 20px 0;
}
.projects a * {
  margin: 0 20px;
  max-width: 40%;
  align-self:
}
.projects h4 {
  color: #9994f7;
}
```
- `.projects a *` is saying grab everything from within that `a` tag, in our case it's going to be the img and the h4. We want to style both of these at the same time, hence the `*`.
- When we are saying `max-width: 40%` we are basically saying, at MAX width, the images will only take up 40% of the actual columns.
- The last thing we want to use is `align-self: center`, this takes the current things we are selecting (the h4 and the img) and align it to the center

The next thing we want to do is get the text up to the side of the images, and to do that we can just say, that the row (everthing in the a tag) is going to have a display of flex. Because when we say that the elements automatically sit next to each other.

### Skills Section
- Want to give this some color a bit to match the #porfolio bg image
```css 
#skills {
  padding: 30px 20px;
  background: #07083E;
}
#skills h3 {
  text-align: center;
}
#skills ul {
  margin: 40px 0;
}
#skills li {
  padding: 10px;
  background: rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
  grid-column: span 4;
  text-align: center;
}
#skills img {
  height: 80px;
  margin: 10px auto;
}
```
- For our `grid-column` instead of saying something like each one goes from `1/4` instead we just want each one to take up 4 columns in width, and that means we are going to have 2 rows because we have 8 columns. The way we do that is by saying `grid-column: span 4`
  - This is going to auto-populate the items in the grid into those columns, 2 on top 2 on bottom.
- We also say `text-align: center` to center them.
- Notice we have no gaps between the grid, so we can go up to our `.grid` class and apply a gap property with a value of 10px.

## Mobiles Styles (Part 3) 

Let's wrap our contact form and our footer
- lets add some padding of 30px top and bottom and 20px left and right.
- a bg color of #080936

We also want to text-align center our h3 and p tags and remove the margin bottom.
```css
#contact {
  padding: 30px 20px;
  background: #080936;
}
#contact h3, #contact p {
  text-align: center;
  margin-bottom: 0;
}
#contact form {
  width: 80%;
  max-width: 400px;
  margin: 20px auto;
  text-align: center;
}
#contact input, #contact textarea {
  width: 100%;
  margin: 10px 0;
}
#contact .button {
  margin-top: 10px;
}
footer {
  padding: 30px 20px;
  background-color: #141636;
  background-imgage: url(assets/footer_image.png);
  background-size: 40%;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: top center;
}
footer .copyright {
  grid-column: 1/3;
  font-size: 0.8em;
}
footer .social {
  grid-column: 7/9;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: flex-end;
}
footer li {
  margin: 0 6px;
}
footer img {
  width: 20px;
}
```
- we want our form to be about 80% of the whole screen. Notice we aren't styling it using `grid` because we don't need to, it's simple enough.
- set its `max-width` to 400px, its never going to be bigger than the max width when its width is 80%.
- use margin: 20px and auto to left and right align it centered
- because we say text-align center our button element should be centered to the page
- give our button a bit more of a top margin 

### Footer 
The reason we are setting the `background-color` instead of just bg , is because are also going to be using an image.
- background-image use the footer image.

Our footer itself isn't a grid, but the first child div is a grid parent...
* remember if we want the columned social icons to be side by side we simply say `display: flex` to get them to be left and right of one another instead of stacked.
- if we want  them aliign to aligned to the right we say: `justify-content: flex-end`
- then give them a bit of left and right margin with `margin: 0 6px;`
- then make the social images have a width of 20px;

## Tablet Styles 

Let's now address the tablet styles around 600px. Starting at the top we can look at our welcome changing it from 1/5 instead of 1/6.


```css
@media screen and (min-width: 620px) {
    .welcome-text {
        grid-column: 1/5;
    }
    .welcome-img {
        grid-column: 5/9;
    }
    .welcome-img img {
        width: 100%;
    }
    .projects {
        margin-top: 40px;
    }
    .projects a {
        grid-column: span 4;
        display: block;
        margin: 20px 0;
    }
    .projects a:last-child {
        grid-column: 3/7;
    }
    .projects a * {
        margin: 10px;
        max-width: 60%;
        margin: 10px 20%;
    }
    .projects h4 {
        text-align: center;
    }
    #skills {
        padding: 30px 100px; 
    }
    footer {
        background-size: 20%;
    }
}
```
- remember we are saying `grid-column: span 4` because we want each a tag to span across 4 columns each.
- right now they are display: flex, so the titles are to the right of the image, we want them below so we change display to block
- give them a 20px margin on top and bottom 0 on the l/r.
- we want the last child to be 3/7 column of the second row and we want them all to be center aligned instead of left aligned 
  - `.projects a *` we are going to set the margin, all around, to 10px , then more margin to the 
- Then text align center the h4.

### Skills
we don't have to do much just add a bit more padding, 30px 100px to bring them more towards the center.

### footer
just change the background size of the footer to about 20%.

## Laptop Styles (Part 1)
- start with the nav, we want that to show now on laptop.
- let's also make some changes to the grid and set the max width of that grid, to not be the full width but maybe only 1000px wide or so at a certain point.
- we want to make sure that its not all left aligned, so we can say `margin: 0 auto`
- When we are changing our site nav to flex-end we can see its almost off the screen, why is that?
  - its because we said the grid should be 100%, but we are also giving the `.site-nav` a padding of 20px left and right
  - we get around this with `box-sizing: border-box`
```css
@media screen and (min-width: 960px) {
    body {
        font-size: 18px;
    }
    .grid{
        width: 100%;
        max-width: 1060px;
        margin: 0 auto;
    }
    .leading {
        margin: 20px 0;
    }
    .site-nav {
        padding: 0 20px;
    }
    .site-nav h1 {
        grid-column: 1/3;
    }
    .site-nav ul {
        display: flex;
        grid-column: 6/9;
        justify-content: flex-end;
        align-self: center;
    }
}
```
- ⭐The last thing we do is with the welcome text with `align-self: center` what this does is it looks at the welcome text, looks at the surrounding context and aligns it to the center of the row (so its more vertically centered).
- let's also add some bottom padding to #welcome

## Laptop Styles (Part 2)

Focusing on projects section. let's get everything to the same line, and drop the second element a little bit to look staggered...
```css
    .projects a:nth-child(1) {
        grid-column: 2/4;
    }
    .projects a:nth-child(2) {
        grid-column: 4/6;
        padding-top: 140px;
    }
    .projects a:nth-child(3) {
        grid-column: 6/8;
    }
    .projects a * {
        max-width: 80%;
        margin: 10px 10%;
    }
    #skills {
        padding: 30px 20px;
    }
    #skills ul {
        margin: 40px auto;
    }
    #skills li {
        grid-column: span 2;
    }
    footer {
        padding: 40px 20px;
        backround-size: 25%;
    }
```
## Desktop Styles
Last thing to tackle is the desktop styles.
- let's space things out a bit more and add some padding
```css
/* desktop styles */
@media screen and (min-width: 1200px) {
    body {
        font-size: 20px;
    }
    #welcome, #portfolio, #skills, #contact {
        padding: 90px 0;
    }
    .projects a:nth-child(1) {
        grid-column: 1/3;
    } 
    .projects a:nth-child(3) {
        grid-column: 7/9;
    }
    .projects a * {
        max-width: 100%;
        margin: 30px 0;
    }
    footer {
        padding: 80px 0;
        background-size: 30%;
    }
    footer img {
        width: 30px;
    }
}
```

## Review Questions
1. What do we use css variables for, and how do we use them?

## Primary Insights
* What! **CSS Variables**, How cool are these! Syntax is:
  - `:root` is the CSS selector that defines its scope. You can use `body` as well, (I also tried `html` and that worked), but stick with `:root`
  - the variable name must begin with two dashes (--) and is case-sensitive
  - the syntax of the `var()` is `var(custom-name, value)` e.g. `var(--secondary, #000000)
    - Note, that `value` is a fallback value used if the custom property is invalid
* The `@font-face` rule. 
  - downloading and importing customize fonts, we use the `@font-face` rule and `font-family` to provide the name for the font. 
  - we use `src: url('/relativePath/fileName')` to provide the location of the font file.
* CSS Grid:
  1. Set your parent/wrapper element's `display` property to `grid`.
  2. Define the number of columns that grid should have and what width each column should be.
    - using the property `grid-template-columns`. The # of values you provide is how many columns you want.
    - the value you pass is their width, e.g. `200px` or `1fr`.
* When you are setting the width of an image element with %, like when we are setting it to 200%, we are actually saying we want the width of that image to be 200% of the images width container, not 200% of the image size itself.
